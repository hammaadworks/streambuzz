-- Scene Intro  
Attention, Streamers!  
Are you tired of managing tons of live chat messages  
while presenting your live stream content?  

Well, it’s time to level up your live chat moderation game!  

Hello, everybody!  
Meet StreamBuzz, your AI-powered live chat moderator.  
With StreamBuzz, you can focus on  
delivering amazing content while it handles the  
live chat chaos behind the scenes.  

This is a submission for Ottomator's Live Agent Studio Hackathon,  
built for the YouTube live streamer community.  
Let's find out what StreamBuzz is all about...  

-- Scene Features  

A buzz is any important question, concern, or request posted on the live chat.  
StreamBuzz fetches those in a queue  
so that streamers can address them at their own pace  
without breaking their flow.  

Plus, they can seamlessly post replies through the StreamBuzz interface,  
making life a lot easier.  

Bonus: StreamBuzz also has RAG baked into it that powers its responses.  

All in all, StreamBuzz is here to supercharge your streaming experience.  

-- Scene Start Stream  

I've started my agent in the background  
and hooked it up with Agent 0.  
Let's start moderating a YouTube live stream.  
For the purpose of this demo, let's moderate this stream.  

Cool! So the agent has registered this stream  
with our session. Let's verify it.  

A background process named Chat Worker will soon fetch  
all the live chats, pick up questions, concerns, and requests, and  
display them here as buzz. Buzz messages are stored in the Buzz Queue, and streamers  
can navigate it using  
"get current" and "get next" instructions.  

Another awesome feature is that StreamBuzz,  
using its intelligence, can intercept multilingual buzz.  
As we can see, this question is asked in Hinglish,  
which is Hindi written in English.  

As discussed, streamers can navigate the Buzz Queue anytime  
by chatting in the lines of getting  
the current or next buzz.  
Here's a demo for that:  
Fetching current buzz...  
Fetching next buzz...  

-- Scene Reply  

With StreamBuzz, replying to live chat is a game-changer!  
You can respond directly from the interface,  
making it super intuitive and saving streamers  
from the hassle of switching tabs.  

Let’s send a reply—“The match is getting interesting!”  
Oops, I made a typo!  
But no worries—StreamBuzz has your back.  
It automatically corrects typos and  
even summarizes messages before posting,  
keeping your interactions smooth and professional.  

Now, let’s check the live chat... Awesome!  
The reply is posted, just like that.  

And the best part? StreamBuzz always keeps you in the loop  
with timely updates, so you’re aware of what’s  
happening behind the scenes.  

-- Scene RAG  

StreamBuzz has RAG-powered responses. That means  
we can add a knowledge base via a TXT file,  
and responses will be generated using RAG.  
It will fall back to LLM responses  
if it doesn't find any matching data.  

Let's go ahead and ask: What is Agent 0?  
To all my viewers, Agent 0 is an amazing tool developed  
by the Ottomator Live Agent Studio team to test out your  
AI agents. Give it a try!  

Not so impressive answer.  

Now, let's upload a document whose entire content is taken  
from the Live Agent Studio Developer Guide.  
Asking the same question:  

It now builds the knowledge base over the text file provided  
and responds.  

The response is bang on!  

RAG also powers the responses generated in the buzz messages.
