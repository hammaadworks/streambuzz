StreamBuzz is an AI-powered multi-agent tool built to simplify live-streaming by acting as a YouTube Live Stream Chat Moderator. It filters key questions, concerns, and requests from live chat, freeing streamers from the hassle of tracking chats and letting them focus entirely on their content. StreamBuzz can also post replies on their behalf, making it a valuable companion that streamlines efforts and optimizes resources.

Created with gratitude for the global streamer community, StreamBuzz was developed as part of the oTTomator Live Agent Studio Hackathon.
